# HackAmherst: Syllascan
Repository for HackAmherst 2018 project.

### Getting Started
Clone the project. You can use the [GitHub Desktop GUI](https://desktop.github.com/) if you'd be more comfortable.
```
git clone
```

Install the project dependencies:
```
yarn install
```


*Note:* You'll need `yarn`, `npm`, probably `homebrew`, `create-react-native-app`, `watchman` and maybe some other global dependencies that I missed.

Navigate into the folder, and launch!
```
yarn start
```
